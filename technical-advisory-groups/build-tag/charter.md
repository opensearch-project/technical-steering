# OpenSearch Project Build Technical Advistory Group Governance Charter

## Purpose

The OpenSearch Project, following Technical Steering Committee (TSC) recommendations, proposes to create a Build Technical Advisory Group that focuses on repository health. This includes managing new repository creation, retiring or archiving existing repositories, monitoring activity in existing repositories, and tracking maintainer status. This group will also establish guidelines for members, set criteria for newly proposed repositories, and come up with recommendations which will then be reviewed by TSC for decision making. The group will provide feedback to the TSC before the final decision is made through voting of TSC members.

## Responsibilities

* Initiate a review of the new repository's proposal / RFC / Issue through a [new repository request](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/issues/new?template=REPOSITORY_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.yaml)
  * Based on [these categories](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/issues/296)
* Ensure new repositories align with the foundation’s [charter](https://opensearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/OpenSearch-Project-Technical-Charter-Final-9-13-2024.docx.pdf)
* Review by a subject matter expert (SME) on the proposal
  * For example, the Build TAG will help contact maintainers from ml-commons repository to review machine learning, neural search, and k-NN related proposals
* Review the naming, proposal topic, and code (if available) in detail
* If the repository needs to be included in a future OpenSearch release bundle, ensure a SME from the OpenSearch Release Team reviews the timelines
